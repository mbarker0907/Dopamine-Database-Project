# Dopamine Database Project
- Overview: This project uses SQLite to store and analyze dopamine levels for activities like social media, exercise, and meditation, with Python scripts to create the database, run queries, and visualize data using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, showcasing SQL, Python, and data visualization skills.
- Files: `create_dopamine_db.py` (creates the database), `query_dopamine_db.py` (runs queries), `visualize_dopamine.py` (generates a bar plot), `dopamine_by_category.png` (the plot), `requirements.txt` (lists dependencies).
- How to Run: Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dopamine-Database-Project.git`, set up a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv` and `.\venv\Scripts\activate`, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the scripts: `python create_dopamine_db.py`, `python query_dopamine_db.py`, and `python visualize_dopamine.py`.
- Sample Query Result: Query `SELECT category, AVG(dopamine_max) FROM Activities GROUP BY category;` yields Substance: 712.5, Digital: 71.67, Natural: 62.5, Mindful: 37.5.
- Visualization: A bar plot of average maximum dopamine by category is saved as `dopamine_by_category.png` and can be viewed in the repository.
- Future Improvements: Add a table to track usage patterns, incorporate user-specific data for dopamine variability, and expand visualizations with more analyses (e.g., dopamine ranges, trends).

- Dopamine Load Query: Run `python query_dopamine_load.py` to calculate and display the cumulative dopamine load by user and date.
- Interactive Visualization: Open `dopamine_load_interactive.html` in a web browser to explore an interactive bar chart of cumulative dopamine load by user and category (hover to see details, toggle categories via the legend).
