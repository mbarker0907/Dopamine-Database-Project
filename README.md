# Dopamine Database Project
This project is a SQL database built with SQLite to store and analyze dopamine levels for activities like social media, exercise, and meditation, using Python scripts (`create_dopamine_db.py`, `query_dopamine_db.py`, `visualize_dopamine.py`) to create the database, run queries, and generate a bar plot (`dopamine_by_category.png`) of average dopamine levels by category with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, showcasing skills in SQL, Python, and data visualization; to run it, clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dopamine-Database-Project.git`), set up a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`, `.\venv\Scripts\activate`), install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), and execute the scripts to recreate the database, query results (e.g., Substance: 712.5, Digital: 71.67, Natural: 62.5, Mindful: 37.5), and plot, with potential future improvements including tracking usage patterns and user-specific data, all licensed under the MIT License.
